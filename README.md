# Pikachu in CSS
I made this with mostly HTML and CSS3, lots of psuedo elements, a flex box wrapper, and some light scripting. 
This was my first pass at making css art and kind of proud of this one.
This wasn't done via tutorial, just from scratch.
This project was interesting as it forced me to reevaluate the common ways I solve problems and think of alternatives to solutions.
